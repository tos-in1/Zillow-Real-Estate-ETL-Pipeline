# Zillow-Real-Estate-ETL-Pipeline
This project simulates a real-world data engineering workflow by extracting Zillow property listings via API, saving the raw response locally, transforming the nested JSON into a clean dataset with Python, and loading the processed output into PostgreSQL. The final database serves as a foundation for analytics, reporting, or future automation.
